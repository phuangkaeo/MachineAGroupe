# MachineAGroupe
# Context of the project
We will come back to the machine-to-group project, the objective will be to improve your final code thanks to good development practices in python. We will use the openclassroom tutorial (see the general tutorial link).

The objective is to resume your code gradually over the chapters and to make a commit for each step:

1. From your code on Notebook, transpose it into code on a .py file (and commit)
2. (general tutorial) Chapter 1: organize your script (and commit)
3. Chapter 2: Work in a Virtual Environment (and Commit)
4. Chapter 3: Organize a project into a module (and commit)
5. Chapter 4: Handling Errors and Bugs (and Commits)
6. Skip part 2 (you will read it if you finish the project quickly), in the last part chapter 1 Understand the good practices of PEP 8 (and commit)
7. (test tutorial) We have already started it, finish part 2, add tests to your code, test the coverage, keep the useful docstests (for documentation purposes) and delete the others (then commit). (Read the last part if you finish before)
